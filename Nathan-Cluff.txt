Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Answer: From my knowledge, an inline element is one in which does not break a new line or take up more than its own space.  Something like a p.
    A block element will take up a full line, and be as wide as your screen.  It also can have a height and width assigned to it.  Inline elements cannot.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
    Answer: The element is taken out of the flow of the elements on the page.  It's position is positioned relative to the first element with the position of 'relative', even if
    it makes it all the way to the body.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
    Answer: You make it an inline-block element.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    Answer: Block -> Div, Section, Header.  Inline -> p, img. Inline-block -> button.

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    Answer: The box model is the content, its padding, then the border, and then the margin around the border.  In other words, the content is like the text,
    image, or whatever you put on the screen.  The padding is the space between that content and the border or wall around it.  The border is exactly what it says.  It is a
    wall or border of the content and padding.  Kind of like a box being packed.  Your gift is in the middle, than you have padding or bubblewrap/peanuts, and the you
    have the box itself which is the border.  After that the space between your box and other boxes or the car/truck is your margin.

    The box model fix, as I understand it to be is box-sizing: border-box.  It helps create stability in our layouts.
